# makria

Makria is an automatic speech recognition software that quietly runs in the background of your computer and sends you a telegram when it detects that your name has been spoken. Using Loopback, it can determine whenever you are called on in any software, including Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, etc. A transcript of the last few lines of conversation will also appear in the telegram, allowing you to understand the context of why you were called on. Now that the user has been notified, they can simply unmute, turn their camera on, and decide what to say based on the transcript.
